## Self-Intoduction 
Agile and adaptable ****** from ****** with analytical mind and background in Digital Marketing.
I do have a history with CSS, HTML as well as C++, Python and C, mainly from my Computer Engineering degree. However, as it goes for all universities degrees it never is about **_practice_** but rather **_theory_**, thus I could finally fall in love with front end development when I had an internship at start-up company  and it was asked to fix theoir website. I had fun with it for straight 24 h. It was amazing!
